Imagine you have a directory containing the following music files:

dir/
	metallica-nothing_else_matters.mp3 
		(ID3 Tags: Artist: Metallica | Title: Nothing Else Matters)
	still_counting.mp3
		(APE Tags: Artist: Volbeat | Title: Still Counting)

This does not look very good and is very unhelpful when browsing the files in a
normal file browser. Even worse are files like "track1.mp3" that only have
correct tags!  This project adresses this problem. If you want to have a clean
and sorted music directory, then it might be worthwhile to continue reading!

tagwalker lets you:
 - reorder files
 - rename files
all with the info contained in their tags! Now that's really helpful!

In 'reorder' operation, you can choose a pattern that will set the directory
structure.  Let's say we want one folder for every artist and subdirectories for
each album.  Then we would have:

dir/
	Metallica/
		Metallica/
			metallica-nothing_else_matters.mp3
	Volbeat/
		Gangsters & Cadillac Blood/
			still_counting.mp3

In 'rename' operation, you can also choose a pattern, but this time it will set
the filename. Let's say we want ARTIST - TITLE.SUFFIX
After that operation, our directory would look like this:

dir/
	Metallica
		Metallica/
			Metallica - Nothing Else Matters.mp3
	Volbeat/
		Gangsters & Cadillac Blood/
			Volbeat - Still Counting.mp3

Now doesn't that look nice? Order has been restored with two simple commands!
And if you don't want to trust your 100GB music collection into the programs
hands, it even has a dry-run mode. It produces a hell of a lot of output, but if
you want to use it, it's there. Enjoy!
